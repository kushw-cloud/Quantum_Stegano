# Quantum-Secured Steganography

This project implements a **quantum key distribution (QKD) based steganography system**, ensuring secure data hiding within images.

## Features
- Quantum Key Distribution (BB84 simulation)
- AES-256 encryption using QKD-generated keys
- LSB-based image steganography
- SHA-3 hashing for integrity verification

## Installation
Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
